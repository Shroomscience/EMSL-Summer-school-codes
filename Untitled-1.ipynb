    "### Random Forest Model for Classifying Site Vegetation\n",
    "#### SOLUTION\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge:** Land managers, agricultural planners, and environmental scientists need to predict what type of vegetation a soil sample can support based on its chemical and physical properties. This information is crucial for:\n",
    "- **Agricultural planning**: Determining optimal crop selection and land use\n",
    "- **Remote sensing validation**: Ground-truthing satellite vegetation classifications\n",
    "- **Construction projects**: Assessing site suitability and environmental impact\n",
    "- **Ecosystem restoration**: Selecting appropriate native vegetation for rehabilitation\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional vegetation assessment requires extensive field surveys and long-term monitoring. **Can we use machine learning to predict vegetation type** directly from readily available soil measurements?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Dataset:** We're working with *real* EMSL data from the [Molecular Observation Network (MONet)](https://www.emsl.pnnl.gov/monet#mission) program (`merged_soil_data_expanded.csv`) that contains:\n",
    "- Chemical properties (carbon content, pH levels, nutrient concentrations)\n",
    "- Physical measurements (texture, moisture, density)\n",
    "- Environmental factors (location, climate data)\n",
    "- Sample metadata (collection methods, timing)\n",
    "- **Target variable**: Current vegetation type (`cur_vegetation`) supported by each soil sample\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Mission:** Build a Random Forest classifier that can accurately predict vegetation categories from soil properties. Random Forest is an excellent algorithm for this task because it:\n",
    "- Handles mixed data types well\n",
    "- Provides feature importance rankings\n",
    "- Is robust to outliers and missing values (common in ecology!)\n",
    "- Offers good interpretability for scientists\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll practice data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation - skills essential for any machine learning project. By the end, you should have a working classifier and understand which soil properties are most important for supporting different vegetation types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Goals:**\n",
    "- Master the machine learning workflow\n",
    "- Understand Random Forest classification\n",
    "- Interpret model results for scientific insights\n",
    "- Apply best practices for model evaluation"

    "**Task:** `import` appropriate libraries and load your dataframe using `read_csv`. Check on the dimensions of the data, and make a barplot of the distribution of vegetation types. Other plots or explorations you might find helpful are welcome. **You will need to drop rows that do not have an entry for the current vegetation type**."

You can choose if or how you'd like to handle missing data, and which predictor columns you'd like to include or exclude. **The choices you make here will make your model perform differently from others**. You'll likely want to exclude unique identifying columns such as `sample_name` or `replicate_number` -- why?.\n",

Higher importance values indicate features that contribute more to the model's decision-making process. Be sure to check out `column_descriptions.csv ` for definitions of cryptically-labeled columns. *Remember: if a feature was not in your original prediction matrix, there's no way for it to appear here*.\n",

    "   - **Recall**: Of all actual samples of this class, how many were correctly identified? (avoid missing cases) \n",

    "\n",
    "**Model Performance Analysis:**\n",
    "- What was your overall accuracy? How does this compare to random guessing (1/number_of_classes)?\n",
    "- Which vegetation types were hardest to classify correctly? What does this suggest about your feature selection or class balance?\n",
    "- Did your model show bias toward predicting certain vegetation types more often than others? How might you address this?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Engineering & Selection:**\n",
    "- Which soil properties were most important for predictions? Were there any surprising results?\n",
    "- How many features did you use? What would happen if you only used the top 10 most important features?\n",
    "- Are there features with very low importance that you could remove to simplify your model?\n",
    "- Could you create new features by combining existing ones (e.g., ratios, interactions)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Tuning & Experimentation:**\n",
    "- How did your hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, etc.) affect performance? Try changing them!\n",
    "- What happens if you use different train/test split ratios (e.g., 80/20 vs 70/30)?\n",
    "- How does your model perform with different missing value strategies (mean vs median vs mode)?\n",
    "- Could you improve performance by handling class imbalance (e.g., using class weights)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation & Validation:**\n",
    "- Are you satisfied with your accuracy, or do you need higher performance for your use case?\n",
    "- Which metrics matter most: precision, recall, or F1-score? This depends on your application!\n",
    "- How confident are you that your model will work on completely new data?\n",
    "- What additional validation techniques could you use (cross-validation, holdout sets)?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World ML Considerations:**\n",
    "- How would you deploy this model in practice? What data would you need to collect?\n",
    "- What are the costs of false positives vs false negatives in your predictions?\n",
    "- How would you monitor model performance over time and retrain when needed?\n",
    "- What would you do if you encountered a completely new vegetation type not in your training data?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps for Model Improvement\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize your Random Forest parameters\n",
    "- **Feature engineering**: Create new features, handle missing data differently, or try feature scaling\n",
    "- **Algorithm comparison**: Test other classifiers (SVM, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) on the same data\n",
    "- **Ensemble methods**: Combine multiple models for potentially better performance\n",
    "- **Data collection**: Identify which types of samples would most improve your training data\n",
